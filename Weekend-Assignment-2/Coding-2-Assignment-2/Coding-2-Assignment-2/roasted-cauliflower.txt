Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven:
   - Preheat your oven to 425'b0F (220'b0C).

2. Prepare the cauliflower:
   - Wash and cut the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Try to keep them fairly uniform in size for even roasting.

3. Season the cauliflower:
   - In a large mixing bowl, toss the cauliflower florets with olive oil, garlic powder, ground cumin, turmeric, salt, and pepper. If you like some spice, you can also add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Toss everything together until the cauliflower is evenly coated.

4. Roast the cauliflower:
   - Spread the seasoned cauliflower in a single layer on a baking sheet. For best results, line the sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
   - Roast in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, flipping the cauliflower halfway through. The cauliflower should be tender and golden brown, with crispy edges.

5. Finish with lemon and herbs:
   - Once roasted, remove the cauliflower from the oven. Drizzle with fresh lemon juice and sprinkle with lemon zest (optional). Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.

6. Serve:
   - Serve immediately as a side dish, or enjoy it as a healthy snack. It's great with a dollop of hummus or a yogurt dip on the side.

Tips:
- For extra flavor, you can add a small drizzle of tahini after roasting, or sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds over the cauliflower.
- If you prefer a more caramelized flavor, roast the cauliflower for a bit longer until the edges are deeply golden.
- Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days and reheated in the oven to keep the crispiness.
