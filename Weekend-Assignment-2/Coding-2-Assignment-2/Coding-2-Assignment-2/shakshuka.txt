 Instructions:

1. Cook the lamb:
   - In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground lamb and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes).
   - Once the lamb is cooked, add ground cumin, ground cinnamon (optional), ground coriander, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and cook for another minute to allow the spices to bloom. Remove the lamb from the skillet and set it aside.

2. Prepare the sauce:
   - In the same skillet, add 1 tbsp olive oil. Add the onion and bell pepper, and saut'e9 for 5-7 minutes until softened.
   - Add the garlic and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning.
   - Stir in the tomato paste, cumin, paprika, turmeric, and chili flakes (if using). Let the spices toast for a minute to release their flavors.
   - Add the diced tomatoes and bring the mixture to a simmer. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar (if desired). Let it simmer uncovered for about 15-20 minutes, until the sauce thickens.

3. Assemble the shakshuka:
   - Return the cooked ground lamb to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Stir to combine and let it simmer for a few more minutes, allowing the lamb to absorb the flavors of the sauce.
   - Create small wells in the sauce with a spoon, and carefully crack 4 eggs into the wells. Cover the skillet with a lid and let the eggs cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny (or longer if you prefer firmer eggs).
   
4. Garnish and serve:
   - Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley. Serve with warm pita or crusty bread to dip into the flavorful sauce.
