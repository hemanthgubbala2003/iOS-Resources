 Instructions:

1. Make the kofta mixture:
   - In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb, onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, paprika, turmeric, salt, pepper, and parsley. Add the egg if the mixture feels too loose.
   - Mix everything together until well combined, then form into small meatballs or oval-shaped koftas, about the size of a golf ball.

2. Cook the kofta:
   - Heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat and cook the koftas for 6-8 minutes, turning them occasionally to brown on all sides. Alternatively, you can bake them at 400'b0F (200'b0C) for about 15-20 minutes.

3. Make the yogurt sauce:
   - In a small bowl, mix the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, tahini, garlic, salt, and pepper until smooth. Garnish with fresh mint.

4. Serve:
   - Serve the koftas with the yogurt sauce on the side, and enjoy with couscous, rice, or pita.
