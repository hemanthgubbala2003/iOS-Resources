 Instructions:

1. Marinate the chicken:
   - In a bowl, mix together olive oil, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
   - Add the chicken thighs and toss them in the marinade until fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for best results.

2. Make the garlic sauce:
   - In a small bowl, whisk together tahini, lemon juice, water, minced garlic, and salt. Add more water as needed to achieve a smooth, pourable consistency.

3. Cook the chicken:
   - Heat a grill pan or regular pan over medium-high heat. Grill the marinated chicken thighs for 5-7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has nice grill marks. You can also bake the chicken at 400'b0F (200'b0C) for about 20-25 minutes.
   - Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly.

4. Assemble the wraps:
   - Warm the pita bread or flatbreads. Place some of the sliced chicken in the center of the bread, then top with sliced cucumber, tomato, onion, and a drizzle of garlic sauce.
   - Garnish with fresh parsley and any other desired toppings like pickled vegetables.

5. Serve:
   - Wrap up the chicken in the pita and serve immediately. These wraps are perfect for a quick dinner or lunch.
