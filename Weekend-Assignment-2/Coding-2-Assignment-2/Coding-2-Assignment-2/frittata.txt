Plant-Based Vegetable Frittata (No eggs or dairy)

Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup chickpea flour (also called besan or garbanzo bean flour)
- 1 1/4 cups water
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast (optional, for cheesy flavor)
- 1 tbsp olive oil (or any vegetable oil)
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 1/2 cup spinach (or kale)
- 1/4 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/4 tsp turmeric (for color and flavor)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp black salt (optional, for egg-like flavor)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, or basil), for garnish
- Optional: 1/4 cup olives or sun-dried tomatoes, chopped

Instructions:

1. Prepare the chickpea flour batter:
   - In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the chickpea flour, water, nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, black salt, and regular salt and pepper to form a smooth batter. It should be slightly thick but pourable. Set aside.

2. Saute the vegetables:
   - Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and saute for 3-4 minutes until softened.
   - Add the bell pepper, zucchini, and spinach (or kale), and saute for another 5-7 minutes until the vegetables soften and any moisture from the zucchini evaporates. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
   - If using, toss in some olives or sun-dried tomatoes now.

3. Pour in the chickpea flour mixture:
   - Pour the prepared chickpea flour batter over the sauteed vegetables in the skillet. Stir gently to distribute the batter evenly. Allow it to cook over low-medium heat for 2-3 minutes until the edges begin to firm up.

4. Add the tomatoes:
   - Gently press the cherry tomatoes into the top of the frittata for some color and flavor.

5. Cook the frittata:
   - Reduce the heat to low, and cover the skillet with a lid. Let it cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the frittata is mostly set but still a little soft in the center.

6. Finish in the oven:
   - Preheat your oven to 375'b0F (190'b0C). Place the skillet in the oven (be sure your skillet is oven-safe!) and bake for another 10-12 minutes or until the top is golden and the frittata is fully set in the middle.

7. Serve:
   - Once done, remove the frittata from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Slice into wedges and garnish with fresh herbs of your choice.

 Tips:
- Chickpea flour is a great base for this plant-based frittata and gives it an egg-like texture and taste. You can find it in most grocery stores or health food stores.
- For a spicier kick, you can add a pinch of cayenne pepper or some diced chilli.
- Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days and are just as tasty reheated.

This frittata is completely plant-based, using chickpea flour as the egg substitute, making it a great option for vegans and those avoiding eggs or dairy. Enjoy!
